# This is specific to the GNU/Linux Bourne shell, and different
# shells and/or OSs will have slightly different syntax, but
# essentially this one-line scripts prepend the folder that our
# package lives in to the $PYTHONPATH environmental variable,
# so that we can import modules from our package from an
# arbitrary location in the filesystem---not only the cwd.
#
# Under Linux do
# source env.sh
# and you're ready to go.
#
# Adapt this to your OS and filesystem.
